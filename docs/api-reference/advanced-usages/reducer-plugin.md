# Reducer Plugin

For advanced users, who want to add additional action handler to indranil-kepler.gl reducer, indranil-kepler.gl provides a reducer plugin function. `Reducer.plugin` will take additional action handlers and return a new reducer function. Plugin is only meant to be called where the store is initialized. The state passed into the additional action handler is the instance state.

`Reducer.plugin` will allow advanced users to extend the indranil-kepler.gl reducer behavior. Here is an example of adding an additional action `HIDE_AND_SHOW_SIDE_PANEL` handler that modifies the `uiState`.

```js
import {combineReducers} from 'redux';
import keplerGlReducer from 'indranil-kepler.gl/reducers';

const customizedKeplerGlReducer = keplerGlReducer.plugin({
  HIDE_AND_SHOW_SIDE_PANEL: (state, action) => ({
    ...state,
    uiState: {
      ...state.uiState,
      readOnly: !state.uiState.readOnly
    }
  })
});

const reducers = combineReducers({
  keplerGl: customizedKeplerGlReducer,
  app: appReducer
});
```

Note that, reducer plugin **should not be used to override default indranil-kepler.gl actions** The following code will not change `SET_FILTER`, because plugins are handled after default actions.

```js
const customizedKeplerGlReducer = keplerGlReducer.plugin({
  [ActionTypes.SET_FILTER]: (state, action) => state
});
```
